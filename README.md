# Data Cataloging (GVR_PROD & IS360)

## Purpose
* The creation of this GVR_PROD catalog will help with consolidating information into one place about each table & will aid in data mapping - as you can just copy and paste information from here into the data mapping document.


## Run Code
* Clone GitHub repository and run the code inside of the 'Data_Catalog_Script.ipynb' file
* While running the code, please do not have the Data_Catalog.xlsx open while running the script
* This should produce an output inside of the Catalog/Data_Catalog.xlsx that looks like this:

<p>
  <img 
    src=Photos/catalog_creation.png
  >
</p>

## After Running Code

* Once the catalog sheet has been populated - navigate to here (see photo below) and press 'Filter'

<p>

  >
</p>

* Slicers don't stick to the worksheet when something is changed inside of the worksheet so creating them again is a necessity.
    * To do so, click into the pivot table located on the worksheet titled 'Catalog Drill Down' and follow the photo steps shown below:

</p>

* Create two slicers by selecting **"Database"** and **"Schema"**
